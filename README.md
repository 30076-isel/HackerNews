The project can be tested using the Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
Run the application and test it, for example on Postman.

I've made the enpoint to receive a parameter called totalStories (by default is 20) in case of want a different quantity of elements.

There is an unit test added on the test project.
With more time, it would be nice to make more unit tests to the Controller and also to the Service.
